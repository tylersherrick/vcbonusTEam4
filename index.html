  <p>Fast running rivers millions of years ago  carved deep canyons from the granite rock. During the glacial period, glaciers  transported vast volumes of rubble, scouring and modifying the landscape. This  left U-shaped canyons, jagged peaks, and rounded domes of glacially polished  granite that inspire awe and wonder.</p>

            <h3>Half Dome</h3>
            <img src="images/half_dome.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" alt="Half Dome">
            <p>Half Dome is the iconic symbol of Yosemite.  It rises more than 4,737 feet (1,444 m) above the floor of Yosemite Valley, and  looks like a perfect dome that has lost one side. Although visible from most  places in the park, one of the best views is from Glacier Point on the south  side of the valley.</p>
            <p>For many years, Half Dome&rsquo;s smooth granite  surface appeared totally inaccessible to climbers, but it was finally conquered  in 1875 by drilling and placing iron eyebolts into the rock. Nowadays thousands  of hikers reach the top each year with the aid of steel cables that act as  handholds. The route has become so popular that it&rsquo;s now necessary to obtain a  climbing permit in advance.</p>
            <p>For the less energetic, viewing Half Dome  from the valley floor and other vantage points in the park remains an  unforgettable sight.</p>

            <h3>Yosemite Valley</h3>
            <img src="images/valley.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" alt="Yosemite Valley">
            <p>Yosemite Valley is the main tourist  attraction in Yosemite National Park. Surrounded by high granite summits,  including Half Dome and El Capitan, the floor of the valley features both  forest and lush meadows. Many high waterfalls cascade from surrounding cliffs,  and are particularly spectacular in spring when water flow is at its peak as  snow melts off the Sierra Nevada.</p>
            <p>The high volume of visitors detracts  somewhat from the spectacular beauty of the surroundings. The wise visitor will  quickly move on to less crowded locations, such as Glacier Point, one hour&rsquo;s  drive away. Glacier Point offers close-up views of Half Dome and a bird&rsquo;s-eye  view of the valley floor 3,200 feet (975 m) below.</p>
            <p>Also close by is Mariposa Grove where you  can wander among ancient giant sequoias, often accompanied only by the local  wildlife.</p>

            <h3>Climate</h3>
            <img src="images/low_cloud.jpg" class="img-rounded img-responsive" alt="Rocks shrouded in low cloud">
            <p>Because of its high elevation (ranging from  4,000 to 9,945 feet / 1,219–3,031 m), you can find yourself literally with your  head in the clouds, one day bathed in brilliant sunshine, the next in swirling  mist and drizzle. Summers are hot in Yosemite Valley, but cold in Winter.</p>
            <p>Yosemite Valley is accessible all year  round, but snow falls in winter, and tire chains are often required on park  roads. Snow closes the roads to Glacier Point and Tioga Pass generally from  November to May. </p>
            <p>When the snow starts to melt in spring,  creeks and rivers are rushing with water. Small, unnamed waterfalls and  cascades appear all along the valley rim. The major waterfalls reach the peak  runoff in May or June.</p>
